Foxnet is my home server this is a gateway to access all of the services it provides. Please login using the username and password you were provided in order to access your available services.

## System status
There are currently some issues, please see the [Status](status) page for more information. Please do not raise a support request until you have checked the status page. I might already know about your issue.

## I don't have a username or password
If you know me personally and I've told you I'd give you access, get in touch and I'll sort you out.

If you don't know me and want access anyway then sorry. This is a local server for local people, there's nothing for you here.

## Why do so many things not work?
This is a beta product and isn't even close to being complete yet, you're lucky you have access at all, stop whining!
